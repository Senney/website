        <p>
          Dedicated, life-long learner with a passion for building scalable,
          intuitive systems and baking bread. I'm building amazing things with
          Neo Financial, defining the future of banking in Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working with a team of diverse, talented, and interesting
          individuals from many backgrounds. Be it developers who have been in
          the industry for years, or brand new programmers who are just learning
          the basics; Every member of a team brings valuable perspectives that
          can lead to personal and professional development.
